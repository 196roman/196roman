i'm roman i'm 17 and i don't know if im ever gonna take this crap seriously i just really like telling the computer what to do.
i like c++. i use visual strudio :)if you are mean to me i will explode in real life and die. thank you.

i like my cat and i like shouting at my computer until it is undeniably evident that it was myyyyyy blunder.

yeah i do take a class but i like to learn on my own. if im not making fun programs i might as well explode in real life and die.

i make a lot of typos because i have a hand tremor that makes it hard to type sometimes. i correct them usually but im just having fun here
