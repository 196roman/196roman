im roman im 17 and im autistic so sorry if i am hard to talk to. i make a lot of typos, this is because i have essential tremor which makes it hard to type. obviously i correct typos in my code but i tend to just leave readable typos in posts/captions/messages/comments/the like.

i don't know if i want a career in this field. i have fun with computers. i like telling them what to do. idiot computers will never take over the world because i control them with my idiot powers.

i take a c++ class but i also go off and do projects on my own to learn new things. i only work with c++ right now because its all im learning. 

i speak spanish, i use visual studio, and my favorite game right now is honkai impact. if youre gonna be insanely rude to me because you have more experience than me and you think im an idiot, you shouldn't bother because i am acutely aware of my lack of experience and it looks weird if you're a lot older than me. like, of course i hadn't thought of that. i haven't been alive long enough to know! criticism is welcome. im in a class by myself, self paced, online, so i dont have peers to talk about this class with. you can tell i dont have an outlet for this interest of mine because of how long i go on and on lol. 

sidenote: im very against crypto and NFTs, which has actually driven me to learn more about how those things work. i like to learn. so even though i dont support it i am curious to know more. thanks for the read.
